## About
iChat is a customizable chatting service based off of Google Firebase. All you have to do is embed the line of HTML (found in `embed.html`) into your HTML file, add the Firebase rules snippet (`database-rules.json`), and (optionally) provide some styling.
## Usage.
You need to have authentication set up with Firebase in order for this to work. The username displayed by iChat is the user's `displayName`.
