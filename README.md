## About
iChat is a customizable chatting service based off of Google Firebase. All you have to do is embed the line of HTML (found in `embed.html`) into your HTML file, add the Firebase rules snippet (`database-rules.json`), and (optionally) provide some styling.
## Usage
You need to have authentication set up with Firebase in order for this to work. The username displayed by iChat is the user's `displayName`.
More information in setting it up can be found [here](https://codewalr.us/index.php?topic=2333.msg60803#msg60803).
